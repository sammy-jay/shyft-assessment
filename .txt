Good day Emil,
Trust you're doing very fine.
Thank you very much for the oppurtunity I had to chat with you. I really enjoyed it.
I was really happy to get started with the assessement you gave me. I had fun doing it.

My Procedure
I started the development of the application using Vite for scaffolding in place of CRA because it improves development speed.
I then went ahead to set-up a folder structure with in turn will help improve scalability.
I installed the necessary dependendies and there wasn't really a ton of them. Basically
	* Redux - for awesome state management
	* Redux-thunk - handling async redux actions
	* axios - for making http requests
I also used CSS in place of frameworks or UI libraries beacause I felt that shows a better understanding of coding in general
I also initialized git which will help tremendously for version control and for making reverts of looking into previous code.

My Understanding
I did take a few hours to understand what functions I had to implement in the app.
I learned that the auth-token belonged to one user with an ID: 100.
After playing around with the API, I noticed that the person was only in charge of some household and that I could only access data related to the user
After displaying and parsing the required data, I displayed them accordingly
I also added a search box which made it possible to look for other residence ID registered under the user I was given

Necessary Links
I hosted the project on netlify
	* netlify url : https://.netlify.app
I also put the source code on github
	* github url : https://github.com/sammy-jay/

Overall, I really enjoyed the project and learnt a great deal. Thank you as you give feedbacks

Cheers.
